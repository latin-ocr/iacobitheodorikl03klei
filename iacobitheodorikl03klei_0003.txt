Klein's Naturalis ‹IIsposi1i0 Ecliinoclermatum (1734)
was one of the earliest monographic treatments of the
sea urchins. 1t includes descriptions, illustrations, and
a classification of both recent and fossil sea urchins.
Klein called these the Echinodermata and divided them
into three classes according to the position ofthe vent.
The classes were then divided into nine sections,
corresponding to the genera ot later authors, and
twenty-two species. Although altered and enlarged,
this work was a major source of information on the
Echinoidea sor zoologists and paleontologists through-
out the eighteenth century and remained a point of
departure in discussions by such early nineteenth-
century authors as James Parkinson.

Klein, who studied law at the University of Konigs-
berg and served as court secretary in Danzig t'rom
1714, had many and diverse interests in natural
history besides sea urchins. He developed a botanical

garden in Danzig, founded and directed a naturalist's ¹

society there, made extensive collections, and published
about two dozen monographs, including studies of
birds, fishes, reptiles, and invertebrates other than the
sea urchins, particularly the mollusks. Fossils are
dealt with in various publications, and Klein edited
the ScIagraphia lithologica curiosa, seu lapidum
nomenclator (1740) of J. J. Scheuchzer, which was
published after Scheuchzer's death.

A principa! concern in his monographs is classifica—
tion. Klein's taxonomic method was based entirely on
external characteristics‚ such as the number and
position of limbs and the mouth; and he vigorously
opposed any method‚ including the Linnaean system,
based on characters not visible externally.

Klein was a member of the St. Petersburg Academy
of Sciences and the Royal Society of London. He was
a frequent contributor to the latter’s Philosophical
Transactions between 1730 and 1748.
